= Cribbage Board

This project outputs g-code to cut a cromulent cribbage board. Set flags for material depth, bit size, and safe travel height all in floating point inches. Note that if you change the bit size from 0.125 (â…›"), your pegs will need to be comically sized as compared to a standard board.

----
Usage of ./cribbageboard:
  -bitsize float
    	diameter of end mill (default 0.125)
  -format string
    	output format (svg,nc) (default "nc")
  -out string
    	file output, empty for stdout
  -tpl string
    	template ([around snake]) (default "snake")
  -zdepth float
    	material thickness (default -0.125)
  -ztravel float
    	safe travel height (default 0.15)

== Example

This example is the "snake" board type. If you'd like a version that goes around a border, use the "around" template.

== Is it good?

I think it works, but it could be optimized in various ways. Importantly, this generator does not include the penguin outer. I created that separately in https://easel.inventables.com[Easel] and spaced this board to fit in its belly. That has been included as `penguin.nc`, but use your own creativity for other designs. You may need to adjust the offsets of the board if you are fitting another design around the holes.
