= Cribbage Board

This project outputs g-code to cut a cromulent cribbage board. Set flags for material depth, bit size, and safe travel height all in floating point inches. Note that if you change the bit size from 0.125 (â…›"), your pegs will need to be comically sized as compared to a standard board.

== Is it good?

I think it works, but it could be optimized in various ways.
